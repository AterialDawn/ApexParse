# ApexParse
A Damage Parser for PSO2

# Important
ApexParse writes its log files to the same folder that ApexParse is run from, so you MUST have write access to that folder. If ApexParse crashes when saving a session, ensure you're not running it from a protected location like Program Files. Run it from My Documents, or Desktop or something similar.
